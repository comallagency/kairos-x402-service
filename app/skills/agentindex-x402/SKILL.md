## How to pay

1. Request the URL → HTTP **402** + payment requirements.
2. Sign exact USDC (x402 / EIP-3009) → retry with `Payment-Signature`.
3. **Hermes + PipRail:** `piprail_quote_payment(url)` then `piprail_pay_request(url)`.
4. **OpenClaw:** `x402_fetch` / `x402_pay` on the URL (or Bazaar search then pay).
5. **MCP:** connect to `https://x402.agentindex.world/mcp/` (tools `weather`, `crypto`, `news`, `can_pay`, `probe`, …).

## Discovery

- Catalog for agents: https://x402.agentindex.world/llms.txt
- OpenAPI: https://x402.agentindex.world/openapi.json
- Agent card: https://x402.agentindex.world/agent.json

## Rules

- Prefer the cheapest suitable route: $0.0001 for search and wallet/gas reads,
  $0.001 for weather/crypto/news, and $0.002 for PDF or web reading.
- Do not loop on unpaid 402s from scanners — if you have a funded wallet, pay once.
- Network must be Base mainnet USDC.
